## real story...

Well, sometimes you would brake something, like small plastic pieces on Saturday evening. Shops are closed or it could even be impossible to get new parts...
However thanks to the thingiverse and ready to go 3d printer things could be fixed really easy!

## The Problem

As we decided to sell an old bed it was necessary to pack everything and fit that to the car. Unfortunately, metal bars fell down by accident... Of course one would never sell something broken (at least why to do so if you clearly see that it is broken!!!) so it was of course impossible to ignore the problem:

And it is not one, but 6 pieces that got broken in one go!

## The Solution

It was Saturday afternoon so shops are closed, but even if they would be opened it's quite impossible to get those small little plastic things:

* Parts may have gone obsolete [-150$]
* Parts needs to be shipped, time [-10]
* Those parts may cost something... [-20]

### Let's look at thingiverse

Good luck when things are already designed. In this case it was!!! In fact, it seems that community did take care of everything designing things that may be of frequent use and could be manufactured with 3d printing

### Parts printed overnight!

Obviously, it's better to print one piece first:

... and then 6 more overnight...

### Now ready to go!

When everything is repaired - it's now easy to sell things!

## The End

Everything fixed and someone will still use the Thing

## Conclusion

In the beginning there was only idea to learn 3d printing skills, restore broken 3d printer and sell it... but now it's clear that it's much better just to keep this device ready at home! As it's not known when it may be useful again...
