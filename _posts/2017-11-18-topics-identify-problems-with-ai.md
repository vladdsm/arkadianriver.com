## Summary

This little article describes the idea of creating a course dedicated to using AI to identify problems.

## Pre-face

Few month ago I went to Bern city centre. I went there with a purpose to visit a place where **Albert Einstein** was living more than hudred years ago. Believe me this place is very hard to find! It's so much hidden around fancy shops and caffee's. The museum is very small and depicting entire life of the famous scientist, however my attention was brought not to the famous formula, not the fact that he had not been good at math or languages. I was shocked with the fact how determine he was to solve problems. He took 1.5 years to solve just one problem. I had a very simple thought: "What if the guy had computing power we have today?"... so I went back home and was determined to think how it's possible to use computing power to solve problems. But then I quickly realized that the first thing I should do is different. I need to find the problem I want to solve first. 

## Why to bother

Here I will explain about the tremendous need of using computers to identify problems

## Combining power of logic and computers

Here I will explain why the idea of using problem solving methods is useful

## Most fascinating part

Here I should say few words about Deep Learning

## Conclusion

Here I should say what are the main findings in the research and next steps

## Final thanks

Here I should say thanks for my family (and git*) to allowing me to spend few time to creating this course :)

_* git allowed me to create course on the go while travelling for work
