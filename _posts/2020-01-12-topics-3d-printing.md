### To be continued

## Discovering something really fascinating!

After getting started in the field of 3D additive printing I decided to write something on this topic!
Actually my goal is to simply describe these two things:

1. How to get started in this field e.g.: Hardware, Materials, Software
2. What engineering capabilities would be added to the Curriculum...


## Hardware and Software

### 3D printer

There are quite a few choices on the market. I started with a simplest AnetA8 printer.
However there are quite some more nice things like [Ultimaker](https://ultimaker.com/3d-printers)

### Materials to melt

3d printers usually works by melting a plastic filament. It can be made usually from PLA or ABS polymers.

### Where to place 3d printer?

The best is to place this device somewhere far from living rooms:

* noise as it may be printing during night
* plastic smell probably not really healthy to breath...

### Where to get inspiration?

To get things or even post things everyone seems to use [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/)

### Software to create 3D models

Blender... this is a free software that can make a very powerful things but at the same time it can be really annoying...
My recommendation is to check out some videos and tutorials from Olav3D:

* Python and Blender (tutorials on Youtube from Olav) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0GTet7PkOuVH26nrfeNfA
* Documentation to the Functions API https://docs.blender.org/api/2.81/bpy.ops.mesh.html

They would teach how to create 3D models using Python code. For example, I did use blender to create a 3D model of the shaft...
feel free to check out this github repo for code: https://github.com/vladdsm/3dpart-blender-python

At the end of modeling the output is usually a file in the format *.stl 

### Software to prepare instructions for printing

Once we have a model in a *.stl format we can use so called 'Slicer software'.
This software will be able to process model and create a sets of instructions for 3D printer.
Every little detail including temperature, movements, internal grids, etc

The most popular one seems to be [Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software)

## Typical 

## Obtain/refresh these Engineering Skills 

* 3D modelling in Blender
* Scripting in python
* Additive Manufacturing

## Conclusion

Another way to make computers to do the job...
