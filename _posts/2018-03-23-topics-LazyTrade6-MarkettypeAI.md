## Detect Market Status with Artificial Intelligence

In this blogpost [7 min read] I would like to explain the motivation behind the sixth course of the series. 

Previous courses of the series were mostly about getting a basis. We tried to look into having a systematic approach in our trading ecosystem. At this point of time we can further develop this ecosystem, enriching it with other elements at our desire. One of the most important elements is probably trading system capability to detect market status. According to Mr. Van K.Tharp it’s insane to expect that one trading system would work in all market types. So this course is just designed to close this ‘requirement’. 

At the end of this course you will be capable to learn how to teach Artificial Intelligence to recognise patterns of six specific Market Types. We will focus on doing that for:

* Bullish Normal Market (BUN)
* Bullish Volatile Market (BUV)
* Bearish Normal Market (BEN)
* Bearish Volatile Market (BEV)
* Ranging Normal Market (RAN)
* Ranging Volatile Market (RAV)

The final outcome of the course will consist in creating an automated task capable to generate Market Type status information for main 28 Forex Currency Pairs! The course was design to let you **learn by doing**. In other words lectures are structured to help student to replicate provided examples. Overall, the concepts covered in this course will help you to :

* Get intuitive understanding of proposed method 
* Set up a system capable to deliver automatic Asset data generation
* Learn how to prepare data for both Deep Learning Regression and Classification algorithms
* Perform both training, testing, productionising Deep Learning Models
* Clarify on example how to use Market Type status with trading robot (provided with the course)
* Getting a workflow of using this robot: How to optimise and deploy to production
* Understand limitations of this method (no holy grail)

**As usual, author hopes that concepts of the course would help to get inspiration and knowledge on how to use Artificial Intelligence to get value for the society!**  

By the way, **This is not a trading advice!** so just relax and have a fun reading for the next 7 minutes!

## Why to detect Market Type status?
 
xxx. 

## How to do that?

Obviously one can decide to apply different methods:

- Indicators
- Machine Learning methods
- Deep Learning

Everyone is free to choose specific method to use, the course however only focuses on using Deep Learning as it’s famous to be great in pattern recognition…

## Assumptions and compromises

In any case several compromises are necessary…

## Main steps to achieve the goal

Course is split in few logical steps to perform the task. 

### Selecting data

### Training model…

### Saving Model

### Using the Model



## Demo trial

 
## It is not a holy grail but probably better…

 — explaining results of demo test

## Conclusion

We know that Market Type is important to avoid insanity of trying to expect that Trading Robot will work in all the market types. The hope is that this course will also help students to ‘engineer’ luck. This is derived from Seneca’s definition of term Luck. It is only coming when we are prepared for the opportunity. Even better if it’s done automatically so we can… "Save Your Time and let Computer Do the Job"
