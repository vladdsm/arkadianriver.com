## Read News and Sentiment Analysis in Forex

In this blogpost [5 min read] I would like to explain the motivation behind the fifth course of the series. 

The title of the course may be misleading. It is not about training an algorithm to decode speech of the Prime Ministers or Central Banks heads in real time and generate trading decisions. No, it is about more simple things and ideas. First is to automatically detect presence of certain disruptive events in the Financial world like elections, key Forex news releases etc. Second it’s about studying polarity score or sentiment of the News headers and trying to correlate that to Financial Markets. Latter idea is probably very naive but in any case, the concepts covered in this course will help you to:

* Learn to perform web harvesting or scrapping to gather information from the Internet
* Be able to automatically disable your trading systems in case matched Macroeconomic news are detected
* Learn to perform Polarity Scoring sentiment analysis of the text
* Perform descriptive analysis of the Polarity Scoring of the News headers from 3 english speaking countries US, UK, CA
* Get the example of trading robot (use at your own risk) to define explore and test the trading idea
* Answer the question: “Are we bombarded by the bad news?” 

By the way, **This is not a trading advice!** so just relax and have a fun reading for the next 5 minutes!

## Know when macroeconomic news are released?

In case our trading system is not designed to capture sudden volatility it may be a good reason to avoid trading on certain days. Decision to do so is out of scope of this course. What the scope is is how to automate this process and to stop trading systems when certain event is going to occur.

## How do we do that?


## Web as the data source…
