## Electrical, Hydrogen driven Mobility with Sustainable Energy?

Topics above are not new. Scientists and engineers already conceptualized them around 100 years ago. And today these topics are back. Still there is tough competition and technical difficulties. Yet progress is there and it's important to know about these topics because they might be a new important trend to catch!

Let me write few words [max 5 min read] about it!

but there are lack of infrastructure...

## Unlimited energy - new golden rush

Thermonuclear power, google trend
