## Why to bother?!

It is not a secret that everyday tonns of fresh food is wasted by restaurants, bakeries, caffees, supermarkets and so on.
There are many reasons to that. Mainly because it is not possible to predict how much food will be consumed. Hence businesses are always preparing some more.
In fact, economically, it's probably better to sell more rather than to sell less. The downside is that there will be always some food wasted...
So this little story is about my personal experience about the project 'TooGoodToGo' App which tries to tackle this problem by providing easy way to purchase food that is still good but is at risk to be discarded if not sold

## What is it

Well it is an app that allows to purchase 'surprise bags' containing [still good] food that is destined to be wasted.

### Examples

* Supermarket: Fruit Salat, Raclette, Bag of Potatoes, Salat...
* Caffee at the train Station: Fresh Orange Juice, Pastry, Sandwiches, Muffins...
* Grocery Store: Sauce Dip, Frozen Vegan Food, Pizza Base...
* Indian Restaurants: Bag with Lunch boxes

### What is the caveat?

* Food needs to be purchased in advance, directly via the App
* Several payment options are available including PayPal
* 50 - 85% cheaper
* Food can be only collected shortly before the shop is closed. e.g. 30-45 min before

## Conclusion

This is not a paid promotion nor I am in any commercial means interested in this project. 
It's just good value for money and above all it's avoid food waste so check it up!
