## The big idea about Lazy Trading

In this blog I would like to cover few ideas. I would like to cover what is the point of even to start looking at it. I would also express my personal opinion about it that it's non-productive and bad for society. Last but not least I would give my interpretation of how one still benefit from this phenomenon without hurting the society...

Lastly I will want to actually bring the explanation of why I am personally looking on that and how I benefited from this topic without gaining or loosing money!

By the way, **This is not a trading advice!** so just relax and have a fun reading for the next 5 minutes!

## Google that: "Hot to get rich?"

To start with, I would ask you to open any of your favourite search engines. Please try to type something like: 

- "How to get rich",
- "How to make money"...

I am almost sure that top search result will be not about how to develop the great idea, working hard, borrow a lot of money, start your own business, fail, resist, start again... Not! The top search will be certainly about Trading. More precisely about *Algorithmic Trading*. 

## Why people trade?

To start develop this subject I would simply say: "Probability to win is much higher than to win in the Loto!"...

## Still, it's bad!

- Speculation, not producing value
- Big players are getting more reach at the expense of all others
- Talented people spending time for that while they could for better purpose
- Broken dreams
- etc

## Why it can give you value?

It's probably the best thing to learn computer and data science!

- Perfect data
- Free software
- You can implement your crazy ideas
- You can see the result
- You can apply what you learn in other, more productive domains

## How you can still benefit?

I think that there would always be people who want to try algorithmic trading. I think that this article is just targeted for those people. I want to bring some ideas for those people on how they can be more efficient with algorithmic trading, how they can exploit this thing for their benefit. Perhaps not to really become reach in few days but how they can learn to be more productive. How they can learn tools or technologies like data science or artificial intelligence... For those people I am developing this series of courses called 'Lazy Trading'.

These courses would not cover basics about trading, however they will build on basics. They will bring you ideas on exploiting it for learning technologies and apply learnings to bring real value to society. At least this was the benefit that algorithmic trading has brought for me!!!

## Conclusion

In my opinion one must definitely know about this subject, break myths and be educated. If you still want to go further you should make sure that what ever you do you do with good faith. If you really capable to win you should try to revert part of gain to the place you live. In one form or another. For example plant a tree, help some public institution or anything like that. Another simple thing is that this should become just a way to learn some technology or tools that can bring value. Something that will help you to learn new things and tools and achieve amazing goals for other domains.
