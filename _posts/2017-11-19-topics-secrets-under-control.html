        <h4>What is information retrieval?</h4>
        <blockquote><i><p>Information retrieval is the activity of obtaining information resources relevant to an information need from a collection of information resources.</p></i>
        - Wikipedia</blockquote>
        <p>In short, information retrieval is the science of seeking information in any kind of sources, including searching for information a document (or the documents themselves), metadata (for describing data), texts, images, or sounds. Many systems use automated information retrieval to provide specific access to sources.</p>

        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
        <p>The process begins when a query is entered to the system. Queries are formal form of request for infomation needed. Information retrieval is needed because there can be more than one object that matches the query. The results shown have the possibility of mismatch, so results are usually ranked based on their degrees of relevancy.</p>

        <h4>Personalized Information Retrieval</h4>
        <p>This refers to experiences of searching that are affected specifically to interests of an individual by merging that individual's personal information (through user profile or such) and query provided to gain the most relevant information.</p>
        <h5>The "Filter Bubble"</h5>
        <p>This system of information retrieval has also triggered several concerns. It decreases the chance of finding new information by leading search results towards the information found previously by the corresponding user. People would wonder why the things they are interested in have become so relevant because of their lack of awareness of the personalized search. The problem has been known as the "filter bubble" by Eli Pariser. It has the potential of leading the users to their own worlds or "filter bubbles", where the only information they can see is the one they want to see, and ends in the wide gap of information spread in the countries all over the world.</p>
        <h5>Advantages</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Improving quality of decisions</li>
          <li>Cost of obtaining information lowers</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Models</h5>
        <p>Here are some ways to personalize the search results:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Historical searches</li>
          <li>Geographical locations</li>
          <li>Similar keywords</li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Disadvantages</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Limiting exposure to new knowledge</li>
          <li>Missing the other side of the issue</li>
          <li>User privacy issue</li>
        </ol>
