# If you're using something other than the mailtome.php script, be sure to also
# edit the /pages/contacts.html file and change/remove the captcha mechanism, too.
# If using mailtome.php, set these, too:
fromaddy: <the email address from which you're forwarding the user's form data>
toaddy: <your email address>

# If you want to use the "Cool tunes" link on the /pages/contact-success.html page
# set this:
spotifyurl: <some playlist, doesn't have to be spotify>
