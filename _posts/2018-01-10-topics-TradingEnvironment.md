## The big idea about Lazy Trading

In this blog I would like to cover few ideas. I would like to cover what is the point of even to start looking at Financial Trading. I would also express my personal opinion about it. I think that Trading is non-productive and bad for society. Lastly I will want to actually tell you about my way of doing Algorithmic Lazy Trading and learn Computer and Data Science.

By the way, **This is not a trading advice!** so just relax and have a fun reading for the next 5 minutes!

## Google that: "Hot to get rich?"

To start with, I would ask you to open any of your favorite search engines. Please try to type something like: 

- "How to get rich",
- "How to make money"...

I am almost sure that top search result will be not about how to develop the great idea, working hard, risking your own capital, start your own business, fail, resist, start again... Not! The top search will be certainly about Trading. More precisely about *Algorithmic Trading*. 

## Why people believe in Algorithmic Trading?

They believe that their winning expectancy will be dominating the loosing expectancy. These people would strive to create systems that will generate lot's of trades. These trading systems would be 'trained' on the past data and typically tested on the independent data to verify the result.

## Still, why it's bad for society!

Typical situation: One person is risking 1 dollar, getting 99 dollars from the bank, instruct broker to buy or sell the asset, close the position after pre-defined price move, return 99 dollar, commission and get the profit or loss, repeat this many time during the day... 

Now, think about it. What is produced? What is the added value? Not speaking about the taxes. Do you know that UK does not tax income generated from such trades? In a summary:

## Why it can give you value?

### It's probably the best thing to learn computer and data science!

- Perfect data
- Free software
- You can implement your crazy ideas
- You can see the result
- Risk free using Demo accounts

### Why do I call it Lazy Trading?

I think that there would always be people who want to try algorithmic trading. However what I want to bring into the subject is to provide ideas for those people on how they can be more efficient with algorithmic trading. The idea is to use top level of supervision allowing to replace trader decision. My goal is to automate what can be automated leaving to the trader just possibility to supervise and maintain the trading systems. Giving to the trader psychological relaxation from the fact that Artificial Intelligence will take care about the situation...

### Why am I creating this series?

First of all this series was created to bring together series of tools that I created while researching the Algorithmic Trading. I wanted to keep this in the structured form to eventually bring that as a completed project one can reproduce. This is because by creating a course Instructor is almost obliged to follow predefined structure of the course.

Second reason is that I am able to learn, practice and obviously share the concepts and methods with my students. Concepts that I am using for real value-added projects in the industry. Concepts that students can take and apply for the real world applications

### What only benefit I can guarantee?

Even though I am not specifically popularizing any particular trading strategy or inefficiency I believe that these courses are bringing the entire framework trader can use to perform his/her own research. This framework can be expanded to suit more specific needs. On top of that while one study and replicate or adapt this framework it will be possible to learn technologies and apply learnings to bring real value to society. This is the only benefit I can guarantee - is to learn Computer and Data Science through Trading.

## Conclusion

I hope that this little article has answered question about the idea of Lazy Trading. Make sure to read specific articles about each course of the series
